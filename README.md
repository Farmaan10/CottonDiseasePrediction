# Cotton Disease Prediction
This Cotton Disease Prediction Web Application is build using Tensorflow-Keras, where we have used a Transfer Learning model namely MobileNetV2. This web application classifies images as a 'diseased cotton leaf','fresh cotton leaf','diseased cotton plant' and 'fresh cotton plant'. While creating a perfect model we trained this Cotton Leaf Image Dataset with different Transfer Learning Architectures. Our model (MobileNetV2) performs fairly good over 20 epochs with a Validation Accuracy of 98.11% on a batch size of 32. This provides a handy tool to utilize the power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to a farmer where time and accuracy is the paramount objective of classification.
